;; Defer garbage collection further back in the startup process
(setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum
      gc-cons-percentage 0.5)

;; Package initialize occurs automatically, before `user-init-file' is
;; loaded, but after `early-init-file'. We handle package
;; initialization, so we must prevent Emacs from doing it early!
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)

;; Inhibit resizing frame
(setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t)
;; enable all disabled commands
(setq disabled-command-function nil)

;; Faster to disable these here (before they've been initialized)
