(defmacro map! (&rest rest)
  "A convenience macro for defining keybinds, powered by `general'.
If evil isn't loaded, evil-specific bindings are ignored.
Properties
  :leader [...]                   an alias for (:prefix dotfairy-leader-key ...)
  :localleader [...]              bind to localleader; requires a keymap
  :mode [MODE(s)] [...]           inner keybinds are applied to major MODE(s)
  :map [KEYMAP(s)] [...]          inner keybinds are applied to KEYMAP(S)
  :prefix [PREFIX] [...]          set keybind prefix for following keys. PREFIX
                                  can be a cons cell: (PREFIX . DESCRIPTION)
  :prefix-map [PREFIX] [...]      same as :prefix, but defines a prefix keymap
                                  where the following keys will be bound. DO NOT
                                  USE THIS IN YOUR PRIVATE CONFIG.
  :after [FEATURE] [...]          apply keybinds when [FEATURE] loads
  :textobj KEY INNER-FN OUTER-FN  define a text object keybind pair
  :when [CONDITION] [...]
  :unless [CONDITION] [...]
  Any of the above properties may be nested, so that they only apply to a
  certain group of keybinds.
States
  :n  normal
  :v  visual
  :i  insert
  :e  emacs
  :o  operator
  :m  motion
  :r  replace
  :g  global  (binds the key without evil `current-global-map')
  These can be combined in any order, e.g. :nvi will apply to normal, visual and
  insert mode. The state resets after the following key=>def pair. If states are
  omitted the keybind will be global (no emacs state; this is different from
  evil's Emacs state and will work in the absence of `evil-mode').
  These must be placed right before the key string.
  Do
    (map! :leader :desc \"Description\" :n \"C-c\" #'dosomething)
  Don't
    (map! :n :leader :desc \"Description\" \"C-c\" #'dosomething)
    (map! :leader :n :desc \"Description\" \"C-c\" #'dosomething)"
